Create in imstack(img,s1,s2) function that creates a stack xstack of size n1 ×n2 ×s, which s = (2s1 +1)(2s2 +1) from the n1 ×n2 image x, such that xstack(i,j,:) contains all the values of x in the neighborhood (−s1, s1) × (−s2, s2). This function should take into account the four possible boundary conditions.\n",
