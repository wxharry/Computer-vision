# Computer vision
An overseas research program for Computer Vision and Machine Learning of Autonomous Vehicles. There are 8 tasks, which cover image processing technique, filtering, edge detection, image enhancement, lane detection, object detection, and deep learning algorithm.

Most of our assignments are in Python language and required to use Jupyter notebook.

Ian is my tutor. He was responsible for distributing tasks to you and keeping track of your progress on a weekly basis.
